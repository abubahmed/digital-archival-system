        <alto:String>“I found the students dynamic, invested, really sharp — they asked such important questions. There's a really exciting vibe,” Kauanui said in an interview with The Daily Princetonian. The Board of Trustees approved Kauanui’s appointment to this position last month. Effective July 1, she will assume positions in both the Department of Anthropology and the Effron Center for the Study of America. While this hire ends the search for the Indigenous Studies professorship, first   announced   in December 2020, it is only the beginning of a continued effort to build up Princeton’s Indigenous Studies program at Princeton. Anthropology Professor Ikaika Ramones said of the students’ gift to Kauanui, “[Students] took time to gather together the day before and create something for her, by hand, with something that grew in the soil in Princeton.” “I think that’s a pretty powerful symbolism of the potential of what can grow here,” he continued.  Growing Indigenous Studies Through the Effron Center  For the past several years, the Effron Center for the Study of America (previously the Program in American Studies) has housed several Indigenous Studies initiatives on campus. In 2020, the Effron Center funded the creation of a   website   for the Native American and Indigenous Studies Initiative at Princeton (NAISIP). “To be in a space ...where they’re bringing in cutting-edge researchers who are engaged in critical ethnic studies within an American Studies context, and [who] understand the importance of Indigenous Studies — that is something that really excites me,” Kauanui told the ‘Prince.’ Effron Center chair Professor Aisha Beliso-De Jesús also confirmed that Effron Center faculty are “working towards the launch of a minor in Indigenous Studies,” and that the University plans to “prioritize future faculty appointments across the university within this vital field.” According to Beliso-De Jesús, the process of filling the Indigenous Studies professorship was “thoroughly collaborative” between the Dean of the Faculty and various academic units, along with engagement from students, faculty, alumni, and community stakeholders. Last fall, representatives from NAP and Native Graduate Students of Princeton (NGSP)   expressed   that they felt “left in the dark” during previous attempts to fill the faculty position and did not have a formal role in the search committee. “We’ve been more aware of everything this time, which has been so much better because it’s felt like we’ve both been involved in the process itself and also afterward we’ve been kept informed,” NGSP president Brandi Bushman GS told the ‘Prince.’ She added that Kauanui was particularly attentive to students’ interests during her visit. “Kauanui was only here for a couple [of] days, but she really developed relationships with the Native Hawaiian students, specifically, and the Native community generally,” Bushman said.
