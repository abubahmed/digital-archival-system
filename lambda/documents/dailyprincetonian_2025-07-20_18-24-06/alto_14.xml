        <alto:String>THE PROSPECT  My favorite places to get espresso in Princeton  Christopher Nunez / The Daily Princetonian  Listen to this article  I am an avid fan of iced drinks. In fact, I run to Nassau Street multiple times a week for a Sakrid Coffee Roasters cold brew or an iced matcha from Small World. However, my preferred drink will always be coffee — particularly espresso. To put it simply, I adore espresso. I grew up with both sides of my family — Greek and Cuban — enjoying a cup of espresso no matter the time of the day. In the morning, my parents would drink a shot of warm espresso. In the afternoon, they would have two or three more shots with ice. After dinner, it was back to a hot shot of the coffee like in the morning. Espresso was a part of my childhood that has never faded away. It is something that I learned to obsessively crave and enjoy every day. In fact, I love it so much that I worked at a coffee shop in high school just to drink more of it on a regular basis. I even have an espresso machine in my dorm room. In honor of one of my favorite musicians, Sabrina Carpenter, releasing her new single “Espresso,” I wanted to share my top recommendations for espresso in Princeton to pay homage to the coffee establishments that I spend so much of my time in. While this beverage ranking is subjective, I wish to share my favorite places that I find myself returning to continuously.
