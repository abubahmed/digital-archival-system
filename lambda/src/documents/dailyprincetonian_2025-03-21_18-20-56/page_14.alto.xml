For athletes, however, the percentage of right-leaning respondents is higher, at around 35 percent. And while non-athletes from the United States are most likely to have come from the Northeast, athletes are most likely to hail from the South.

Vincent Etherton is a staff Data writer for the ‘Prince.’  Who takes gap years?, Oct. 3  Approximately 7.4 percent of the Class of 2028 Frosh Survey respondents reported that they took a gap year before coming to Princeton.
