She visited campus last October, when she gave a talk on   Hawaiian decolonization and feminism . According to the President of Native Graduate Students of Princeton (NGSP) Brandi Bushman GS, Kauanui “ really developed relationships with the Native Hawaiian students , specifically, and the Native community generally” during her visit. Kauanui has taught in the American Studies and Anthropology departments at Wesleyan since 2000 and   founded the Indigenous Studies Research Network . At Princeton, she is looking forward to collaborating with existing Indigenous studies initiatives on campus and to   “do something bigger”   with studies of global indigeneities.
