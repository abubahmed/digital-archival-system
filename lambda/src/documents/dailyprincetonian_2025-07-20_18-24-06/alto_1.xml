Louisa Gheorghita / The Daily Princetonian  Listen to this article  This year, 27 seniors   declared   their candidacy for Young Alumni Trustee (YAT). The high number of candidates is hardly a surprise: As members of the 40-person board of trustees, Young Alumni Trustees have significant influence over the University’s governance, budget, and   $34 billion dollar   endowment. There is no doubt that YAT is the most powerful position that an undergraduate can run for, making it no surprise that YAT attracts some of the best talent from across the Class of 2024 to run.
