        <alto:String>Kauanui has taught in the American Studies and Anthropology departments at Wesleyan University since 2000 and founded the school’s Indigenous Studies Research Network. She also served on the steering committee, as an inaugural council member, and as a co-founder of the Native American and Indigenous Studies Association. “She has really seen and helped build the field, not even nationally, but internationally,” Ramones said. When Kauanui came to visit, “it was like talking to someone who immediately already had her finger on the pulse and was just ready to get started,” he added. Last fall, Bushman also told the ‘Prince’ that attracting professors to campus when Princeton does not yet have a full Indigenous Studies minor or department could prove difficult. “The Native community, more generally, is small, but we’re very present, and we’re very active,” Bushman said. “I think [Kauanui] saw a community on campus that is wanting to get work done, wanting to collaborate, and wanting to build something. She’s such a builder.”  Collaboration Across Departments  In her conversation with the ‘Prince,’ Kauanui emphasized her desire to collaborate with existing Indigenous studies initiatives on campus, including NAISIP and the Princeton American Indian and Indigenous Studies Working Group (PAIISWG). “She came with a boatload of expertise, but also a very attentive ear, which I think is a really good combination for something like this,” Ramones said. “I know that there are other faculty across the campus who are interested and engaged in research pertaining to Indigenous peoples, and I’m really excited to be in conversation with them and to think about different initiatives that we might do together, whether it be workshops, conferencing, [or] research labs,” Kauanui said. Specifically, she hopes to “do something bigger” with studies of global indigeneities and the   LANDBACK movement . Kauanui also mentioned several potential course offerings adapted from her work at Wesleyan, including Decolonizing Indigenous Gender and Sexuality, Indigenous Women and the Politics of Feminism, and a research course on the LANDBACK movement. “The presence of the field on campus is just going to be much more of a thing than it’s been,” Bushman said. “In this past year, it’s already changed so much. It’s very exciting to know that it’s going to keep growing.” “There’s a lot of potential and a lot of excitement,” Kauanui said.
