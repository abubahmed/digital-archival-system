        <alto:String>But with every sweet treat with my friends and every burst of laughter during dinner, I come closer to finding peace with my eating, a peace I couldn’t get myself to work toward back home. To other people suffering from these same issues on campus, I encourage you to find ways to use food as a point of connection. For me, that shift has turned mealtimes from something to fear into something to love.
