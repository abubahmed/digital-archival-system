        <alto:String>4. Small World  When I go to Small World, I usually only get the iced matcha or NoLa cold brew; I get both of these drinks weekly. However, I now find myself running to get espresso at this staple coffee shop all the time. Small World’s espresso tastes sweet yet sophisticated, with multiple layers to each sip. It is simple, without too many prominent, differing tones that would overcomplicate the coffee’s essence and thus reduce it down to an occasional type of drink. Their espresso has become a daily craving of mine.  3. Coffee Club  I appreciate the convenience of Coffee Club. Whether you are heading up-campus or down-campus, the two flagship locations at Campus Club and Addy Hall in New College West make it easy to get a drink to-go. I usually order two shots of espresso, only over ice. Coffee Club’s espresso tastes the best when cold, which helps boost its flavor profile. There is a slightly nutty, earthy taste that I really like. While occasionally I have had it hot, the ice creates the perfect blend of bitter and delicate boldness: a must try for all.  2. Chez Alice Pâtisserie  Chez Alice’s beautiful ambiance is a joy in every regard. The adornment of the shop is complemented by the aroma of the plethora of sweets on display for sale. However, I always go to Chez Alice with the intention of ordering hot espresso. Their espresso is best served in a steaming cup, which brings out its most delectable aroma. It is warm and inviting, the type of coffee that makes you feel as if you are drinking a cup in the comfort of your own home. This is one of those circumstances where breathing in the wafting smoke of the coffee is just as enjoyable as drinking it.  1. Sakrid Coffee Roasters  Sakrid is my absolute favorite coffee place in Princeton, and maybe even the best that I have ever had. In fact, if I had to only have espresso from one place in Princeton, my answer would always be Sakrid. Its espresso is delicious both hot and cold. I personally find it difficult to have a shot that works well both hot or over ice. Oftentimes at other shops, the espresso needs to be diluted with ice due to its extreme bitterness, or it is already too watery and thus can only be drunk hot. However, Sakrid’s espresso is beyond marvelous no matter how it is made. There is a velvety boldness to each sip that keeps me returning to it over and over again. It is always consistent; their coffee never is a hit-or-miss. I usually get a double shot over ice: the key to my perfect day.
