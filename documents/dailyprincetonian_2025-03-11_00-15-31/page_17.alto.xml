While the non-binding nature of SCEA allows students to apply to other universities during the regular decision round, these figures suggest that most students admitted to Princeton early did not take advantage of the process’s flexibility because Princeton was their top-choice institution.

This trend is echoed as far back as the   Class of 2024 , which revealed that 75.8 percent of legacy matriculants were accepted early, compared to just 48.8 percent of non-legacy matriculants.  3/11/25, 12:15 AM   The Data Blog: 2028 Frosh Survey - The Princetonian  https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2024/10/princeton-data-blog-frosh-survey-2028-results-analysis-chart-crosstab-longitudinal   8/9</alto:String>
