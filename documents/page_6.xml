        <alto:String>Mann added that consulting was still a viable career path that she does not discourage students from entering, saying, “Some of my best students have gone into consulting, but that doesn’t mean I love them any less for it.” Professor Udi Ofer, founding director of the SPIA’s Policy Advocacy Clinic, expressed excitement over the department’s increased funding towards more programs oriented towards public service. “I think it’s all about giving students choices. Our job is to make students informed ... It’s my job to show students what a life could look like if they chose a similar career path as a lawyer or as a policy strategist,” he said. However, the SPIA department emphasized that the purpose of programs like “SPIA in D.C.” and “SPIA in N.J.” is not to devalue consulting, but instead present more public service opportunities to SPIA students to provide a broader choice of careers. “There is no attempt to guide students away from [consulting] jobs,” said Senior Associate Dean Paul Lipton. “Our objective as an undergraduate program is to give students a much broader sense of what is possible and ways to get there.” “Anyone who believes that going into the private sector is a harm is misunderstanding and misrepresenting what those jobs do for anybody, whether students or the constituents they serve,” continued Lipton. “It is certainly not our perspective that these jobs are harmful or undesirable.” According to Lipton, SPIA hopes to encourage students who are passionate about public policy and service, but either lack information or are considering more profit-oriented careers. Lipton encouraged students in doubt to “come right to us ... we have a wonderful and long list of alums who are more than willing and happy to discuss career opportunities in a variety of fields.” “A lot of students come to SPIA because they want to save the world, and that is a great instinct to have, and we want to nurture that,” said Ofer. “Different people have different life circumstances and they have to make tough decisions,” Ofer added. “It’s our job at SPIA to make sure they have all the information they need ... and support them in whatever option they choose.”  Eojin Park is a News contributor for the ‘Prince.’ Please send any corrections to corrections[at]dailyprincetonian.com.  3/10/25, 10:45 PM   SPIA strengthens its commitment to providing students with public service careers - The Princetonian  https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2024/10/princeton-news-stlife-spia-commitment-public-service-opportunities   3/3</alto:String>
