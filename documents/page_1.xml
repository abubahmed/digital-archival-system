Leaves from the trees surrounding the lawn’s perimeter have drifted towards the ground, and the ones that still cling to the branches have turned from green to orange. With each step, the crunch of fallen foliage fills the air as people walk by. As I drag two remaining lawn chairs closer together, Feldman approaches from across the green.
