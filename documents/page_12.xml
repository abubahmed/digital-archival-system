        <alto:String>In a   Q&amp;A with the Daily Princetonian last year , University President Christopher Eisgruber ’83 said that his first priority over the next five years is “rebuilding and fortifying our School of Engineering and Applied Science,” because as the field of engineering rapidly expands, the University wants to prioritize having resources and amenities that support the discipline and all those interested in it. More largely, Eisgruber pointed out that having a “great engineering school” is integral to a “great” liberal arts education. The class of 2028’s interest in engineering reflects the discipline’s increased popularity within Princeton over the past few years.   33.25 percent   of the class of 2026 declared a major within an engineering discipline, the second-highest number of engineers since 2017, marking a decrease in humanities majors from 16.7 percent in 2017 to 11.57 percent in 2026. Despite this trend, Eisgruber noted that while the decrease in humanities majors is reflected across Princeton and the nation, the liberal arts curriculum at Princeton ensures that all students are involved in humanities during their time at Princeton. Increased interest and investment in engineering at Princeton follows a national trend:   the number of undergraduates majoring in engineering   has sharply increased since 2000. It remains to be seen what this means for the future of engineering education.

Comprising   18 percent   of the undergraduate population, athletes have dramatically different lives compared to those of non-athletes, structuring their class schedule to accommodate daily meetings and practice times as well as weekly travel. According to the Class of 2028 Frosh Survey, incoming athletes and non-athletes differ significantly in both their lifestyles and views.
